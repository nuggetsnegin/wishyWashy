# Wishy Washy
A wholesome wishing board created in React. User's may input a wish anonymously which is stored into a database (Firebase) and show their support for other wishes by hitting the heart button! Most recent wish is always displayed on the left-hand side of the screen while 8 other wishes are randomized and re-renders on 'heart' or user input.

(Also features bad word censoring!)

## Built With

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
* [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Animista](https://animista.net/)
* art by me!



## Stretch Goals
* Implement more robust word censorship. :'(
* Optimize mobile experience - currently when more wish bubbles display on the screen it lags. Potential solutions may be to reduce 9 bubbles to 3-4 or tweak display speed.
* User login feature to save and keep track of wishes and check in on 'hearts'.
